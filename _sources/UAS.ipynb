N_Days: jumlah hari antara pendaftaran dan kematian yang lebih awal, transplantasi, atau waktu analisis studi pada Juli 1986\n","3. Status: status pasien C (disensor), CL (disensor karena tx hati), atau D (meninggal)\n","4. Obat : jenis obat D-penicillamine atau placebo\n","5. Umur: umur dalam [hari]\n","6. Jenis Kelamin: M (laki-laki) atau F (perempuan)\n","7. Asites: adanya asites N (Tidak) atau Y (Ya)\n","8. Hepatomegali: adanya hepatomegali N (Tidak) atau Y (Ya)\n","9.
